            <p id="intro">
              At the coffee shop that I am working in, we have three types of coffee beans: Brazil, Colombia, and Nicaragua. All of them are unique and have different flavor notes and roast types. However, all types are deeply loved by our customers - it is up to each of them individually to choose which one they prefer the most. My personal favorites are Columbia beans. What about yours?

              The first type of coffee I am introducing to you is Brazil. It has a relatively low acidity, and exhibits a nutty sweet flavor, which is often bittersweet with a chocolaty roast taste. People who enjoy drinking their coffee with milk like this type a lot. In our coffee shop, Brazil coffee beans are the cheapest, yet flavor-wise they are not worse in any way than the rest. The flavor notes range from milk chocolate to bitter cocoa and toasted almond, caramel. It has a distinct flavor, low in acidity, smooth-bodied, and sweet.

            The second type of coffee is Colombia. This coffee is mostly arabica beans. The two main types of coffee beans which are grown in the world are Arabica and Robusta, so it steals the spotlight here with that. Arabica is lighter and sweeter, whereas Robusta is bolder and denser. Colombia has a light and flowery taste that many coffee lovers crave and is a great choice for those who do not have their preference yet. Main tasting notes are nuts, chocolate, herbs, fruit, and a citrusy acidity. It has a silky body, tropical notes, and fruity, spicy aroma. It goes well with milk-based coffees as well as plain black/espresso. It is second in a range of prices in my coffee shop.

            Nicaragua
          </p>
          <p id="nicaragua-description">
            The third type, but by far not the least is Nicaragua. Nicaraguan coffee typically means Arabica beans, with a medium body, mild acidity, and a hint of fruity or caramel sweetness. While aroma has sweet caramel, citrus, and chocolate elements, the coffee itself can have a very pleasant, rich, balanced, and bittersweet flavor. It is mostly liked by people who do not add milk to their coffee, but it tastes great with milk-based coffees as well. It is the most expensive coffee type in our coffee shop and so far the dominating favorite among clients.

              My journey of becoming a barista began with a big dream. Whenever I would go to a coffee shop, I would observe every movement that a barista makes while making a coffee and it would brighten up my day. I always was fascinated with how much love they put into what they do and how wonderful their work tastes afterwards. With this in mind, I have set myself a goal, which in a long term, turned out to be my biggest dream - becoming a barista and one day open my own coffee shop.

            <p id="about-me-2">
              As soon as I have graduated from high school, I took a gap year and began to pursue my dream. I went to multiple coffee shops looking for a job opportunity and I have tried working in a couple of them. I loved and appreciated the experience I gained in each place but nothing compares to the place I am currently in. I am a barista in coffee place in Palanga called Benuk. The owners of that place are close family friends of my family and the atmosphere in that place is just wonderful. I am proudly calling it my second home and until I will reach my ultimate goal of having my own coffee shop, there is no place I would rather be than here.

            So far, I have been working as a barista for almost 4 years now and I am learning something new every day that I am at work. I love making coffee and coffee makes people happy: simple as that, I make people happy. My loyal clients are my friends now, we share personal conversations with each of them, therefore, they always feel welcomed and waited for. Besides loving the process of making coffee and communicating with clients, I also love experimenting with different syrups and sauces, combining new and unique coffee drinks for others to try. I feel at peace whenever I am at work and it always makes me happy, for this reason, I could not imagine a better place to work at: all day you get a chance to make coffee, talk to people, roast beans, try different coffee drinks, and, most importantly, DRINK COFFEE YOURSELF! What a time to be alive.
